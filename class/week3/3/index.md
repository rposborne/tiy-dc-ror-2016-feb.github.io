 Write a method which accepts an array and returns a hash.  Each item in the array will be a string, and the returned hash should have last names as keys and first names as values.
ActiveRecord and Unit Testing

**Challenge:** [Arrays and Hashes](https://github.com/rposborne/rails_assignments/blob/master/challenges/array_and_hash_challenge.rb)

**Problem of the Day:** [Phone Numbers Active Record](https://github.com/rposborne/rails_assignments/blob/master/exercises/phone_numbers_active_record)

* Agile Principles
  * ON BOARD: All code becomes legacy code.
  * Arguably, worked on some last night.
  * Definitely working on some this weekend.
* ActiveRecord Models
  * Using `irb` accesses the same database as `ruby ...`
  * `.new`
  * `.save`
  * `.create`
  * `.update`
  * `.all`
  * `.first`
  * `.find` and `.find_by_id`
  * `.find_by_name`
* Relations
  * `.where`
  * `.order`
  * `.count`
* Basic Associations
  * `has_many`
  * `belongs_to`
* Unit Testing
  * Test database vs development database
  * `def setup` and `def teardown` (for migrations)
